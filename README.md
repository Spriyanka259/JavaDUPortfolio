# JavaDUPortfolio
This is my Portfolio project for the course Java Programming. This project tracks cars, their owners and the car shows each car is registered which was developed in the duration of ten weeks in Agile approach. Each week the requirements change and evolve where the development of the project is enhanced based on them. Below are the changes made to the project each week.
Week 2:
  Domain classes and Java Enumerations are created based on the UML diagram provided. These classes will consist of getter setter methods, toString, equals and       hashcode methods.
  E.g.: Owner.java, Vehicle.java, CarShow.java
Week 3:
  Service classes are created to act upon domain classes primarily to store multiple domain objects. These classes will consist of the collection ArrayList to       implement and store the domain objects.
  E.g.: VehicleArrayListImpl.java
Week 4:
  The input data is read from a file and stored into service classes for later manipulations. Exceptions are added to make the project robust enough.
Week 5:
  HashMap implementation is added to the part of service classes besides ArrayList for more Collections practice.
  E.g.: VehicleHashMapImpl.java
Week 6:
  More service classes are added to read and write XML and Json files.
Week 7:
  A simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) is created using JFrame in NetBeans so that the user can play around the data of owners, vehicles and car shows.
Week 8:
  Controllers are added to the project so as to update it as an MVC project.
Week 9:
  Login Authentication is added to authorize users before navigating to the user interface.
Week 10:
  JavaDoc has been generated for the final project.
